# Info/Repository-Reason

Welcome to my Script holding github repository.

This repository holds my scripts/GUI's for Roblox.

Please Note: These scripts are ~~all~~ obfuscated. So finding source is pretty hard considering how its obfuscated good. Also, this repository is ***ONLY*** for:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet(' (loadstring link here) '))()
```

You can copy raw source and paste it directly into your executor, but that isn't very convenient. Some issues for pasting raw code may include:
- Executor Lag
- Executor Crashing
- Script not functioning right
- Executor Erroring Script
- Roblox Crashing
- Script not loading
- Etc

Please use the loadstrings provided in the file "Loadstrings and games". The loadstring shortens the code to a one line script, fetching the github raw code and enforcing it into the Roblox ingame files. It works on much more executors and is much more nice to see/read.

## Executors
Finding the best Roblox executor may be hard. and/or you may not know who to trust considering it may put a virus on your computer (trust me, i've been there before sadly)

Here are some of the most trusted and best working executors out there:

- Synapse X (This is a paid executor costing $20. Best executor I know and is also the one I use. Very easy and smoothly put together, also can run basically every script!)

- KRNL (This is number 2, because however this executor is good and its free, it as a KEY to put in every time, which can get annoying pretty quickly)

- JJSploit (This executor is number 3, People claim this executor has a virus/coin miner, and it is free, No key either, however it can ***NOT*** execute big scripts)
